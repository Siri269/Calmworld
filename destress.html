      <h1>Diet</h1>
      	<p> A balanced diet helps manage pre-test stress by providing stable energy, boosting mood-regulating neurotransmitters, and reducing inflammation. Eating complex carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats prevents blood sugar crashes and provides sustained energy, while foods rich in B vitamins, vitamin C, and omega-3s support brain function and stress hormone regulation. Limiting caffeine and sugar also prevents jitteriness and heightened anxiety. </p>
